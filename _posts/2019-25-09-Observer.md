The observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

An example of this would be:
1. A user manipulates a value by using a `setValue();` method
1. The `setValue();` method changes a private value and it calls `setChanged();`
1. A method called `notifyObservers();` is called to notify the observers that that the observed has been changed.
1. An `update();` method is called on the observers, indicating that a change has been made


A method of the Observer:
`public void update(Observable obs, Object obj);`
